# vban2mqtt

A fresh project to connect your VoiceMeeter to Home-Assistant via MQTT.

This is a very early stage where things will definetly change, so expect things to brake at some point or not.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
